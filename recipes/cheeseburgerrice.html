    <h4>Ingredients</h6>
    <ul>
        <li>1 tablespoon oil</li>
        <li>1/2 medium onion, finely chopped</li>
        <li>1 pound ground turkey or ground beef</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
        <li>3/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper, divided</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
        <li>4 tablespoons ketchup, divided</li>
        <li>2 1/2 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce</li>
        <li>1 (14.5 ounce) can beef broth</li>
        <li>1/4 cup water</li>
        <li>1 cup rice</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons mayonnaise</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons yellow mustard</li>
        <li>8 ounces Cheddar cheese, shredded</li>
        <li>chopped dill pickles and lettuce</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat oil in a large, deep ovenâ€“proof skillet over medium-high heat.  Add onion and cook, stirring constantly, 1 minute. Add ground turkey and cook, crumbling with a spoon until lightly browned, about 7 minutes. </li>
        <li>Season with salt, 1/2 teaspoon pepper, garlic powder, 3 tablespoons ketchup, and Worcestershire sauce and stir to combine. Add broth and water and bring to a boil, stirring often to loosen any browned bits from the bottom of the pan. </li>
        <li>Stir in rice and return to a boil. Cover and reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until liquid is absorbed and rice is tender, about 20 minutes. Add up to 1/4 cup additional water if needed if liquid is evaporated before rice is tender.</li>
        <li>Just before it is finished, stir in 1 1/4 cups of cheese to rice mixture and top with remaining cheese.</li>
        <li>Broil in the preheated oven just until cheese is melted and bubbly, about 3 minutes. Let stand for 5 minutes before serving.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, for burger sauce, add remaining pepper and remaining ketchup with mayonnaise and mustard in a small bowl. Stir until well combined and set aside. Serve topped with pickles, lettuce, and burger sauce.</li>
    </ol>
