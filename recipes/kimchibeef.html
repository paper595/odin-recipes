    <h3>Instead of the same old corned beef and cabbage recipe every year, try this new and exciting Korean twist on the St. Patrick's Day staple.</h4>
    <h4>Ingredients</h6>
    <ul>
        <li>1 (3 1/2) pound ready-to-cook corned beef</li>
        <li>2 (16 ounce) jars kimchi, not drained</li>
        <li>1/2 cup cold water, or as needed</li>
        <li>2 pounds Yukon gold potatoes, quartered</li>
        <li>3 large carrots, cut into large chunks</li>
        <li>2 ribs celery, cut into large chunks</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Pour 1 jar of kimchi into a pot. Top with corned beef and cover with the second jar of kimchi. Pour in water. Cover and bring to a simmer over high heat. Reduce heat to low. Cook, covered, until fork-tender, 2 to 3 hours. Flip over the beef occasionally and drape kimchi back on top. </li>
        <li>Remove corned beef to a bowl. Bring kimchi mixture back to a simmer over high heat. Add potatoes, carrots, and celery. Cover, reduce heat to medium-low, and cook until almost tender, 20 to 25 minutes. Reduce heat to low and add beef back in. Cover and cook on low until meat is heated through, about 15 minutes. Taste the broth and add water as needed. </li>
        <li>Slice corned beef thinly and serve in a bowl with the vegetables; spoon some broth on top.</li>
    </ol>
